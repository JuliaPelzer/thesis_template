Latex Template for VuV, date 28.05.2021

# Most important notes:

Install a Latex distribution. I personally recommend TexMaker (https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/).
The organisation of literature is well supported by Jabref. By \cite{your_Bibtextkey} the sources can automatically be inserted into the bibliography chapter.

If you have questions, various forums on the internet usually offer valuable insights.

Before you work with the template you have to unzip it.

While working with the template, please insert your content in separat files and include them in the main file "bericht.tex". Thereby changes in form and optics can be done without interacting with your text.
